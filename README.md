# Adaptive Multimodal Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (AMC-ACO)

This project implements **Adaptive Multimodal Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (AMC-ACO)** for solving complex multimodal optimization problems. The algorithm enhances standard Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) by integrating clustering techniques, adaptive local search, and solution refinement strategies.

## Features

âœ… **Clustering for Crowding & Speciation** â€“ Efficiently distributes solutions across multiple peaks.  
âœ… **Solution Construction for Ants** â€“ Optimized exploration and exploitation mechanisms.  
âœ… **Adaptive Local Search (ALS)** â€“ Dynamically refines promising solutions.  
âœ… **Local Search-Based AMC-ACO Variants** â€“ Implements LAMC-ACO and LAMS-ACO for improved optimization performance.
